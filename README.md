Hi , I'm Kevin Le! üòÅ

I am a full stack developer seeking to solve real world problems. After excelling in my automotive painter career, I decided to complete a coding bootcamp and start a new adventure into technology. I have generated personal projects using Python, Java, and MERN tech stacks. I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I hope to contribute my skills to web applications that may simplify people's lives. I respect others' points of view through engagement and interest. As a former master automotive painter, I am determined to utilize my skills to my future as a developer. My interests are food, traveling, video games, and the world of J.J.R. Tolkien.
